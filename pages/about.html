      <h2>Meet IFMedical</h2>
      <p><strong>IFMedical</strong> is a student-led initiative founded by Isabella Ford, a premed navigating the challenges of medical school preparation. It started as a personal project to document resources, tips, and encouragement for others on a similar path.</p>
      <p>We believe that access to opportunity, clarity in planning, and encouragement from real students can make the premed process more humane and hopeful.</p>

      <h2>Why “IF”?</h2>
      <p><strong>IF</strong> stands for <em>always Thinking</em>, <em>Questioning</em>, and <em>Exploring</em>. It’s about always asking, “what if?” That curiosity fuels medicine, and we aim to support it in every student.</p>

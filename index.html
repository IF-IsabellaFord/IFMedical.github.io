      <h2>Welcome to IFMedical</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>IFMedical</strong> is a student-created survival guide for premeds navigating the path to medical school. 
        Created by Isabella Ford — a 3x MCAT taker, researcher, and advocate — this space is for anyone who’s 
        ever felt overwhelmed but still determined to become a physician.
